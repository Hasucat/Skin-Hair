                <h2>BOTOX® / Botullinum Toxin</h2>
                <p>BOTOX® is the world's most popular anti-ageing treatment with literally millions of people around the world benefiting from anti-ageing and medical applications.</p>
                
                <p>BOTOX® is a prescription-only drug (botullinum toxin). In anti-ageing treatment, it is injected into the face in order to relax the facial muscles and improve the appearance of wrinkles and creases.</p>
                
                <p>BOTOX® is also used in non-cosmetic procedures as a treatment for many conditions including migraines and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).</p>
                
                <p>It is very safe when used by qualified and experienced doctor practitioners. Recovery time is short in comparison to many other cosmetic procedures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Treatment Duration</h3>
                <p>Treatment takes about 15-20 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How does BOTOX® work?</h2>
                <p>When BOTOX® is injected into the patient's face, it relaxes the contraction of facial muscles by blocking nerve impulses. Since these muscles will no longer be able to contract, the face relaxes and this softens and reduces wrinkles and creases in the skin.</p>
                
                <p>The treatment is not permanent, so patients should anticipate re-treatments every few months to prevent further wrinkles from appearing, though each injection should also reduce the depth of newer wrinkles. In this respect, BOTOX® can also be used preventatively, to delay the appearance of wrinkles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Who is BOTOX® for?</h2>
                <p>BOTOX® is a popular choice with men and women who wish to reduce the appearance of winkles and frown lines, typically around the face and neck. While this is the most common application of BOTOX®, it can also be used to treat severe brow furrow, uncontrolled blinking and lazy eyes. BOTOX® patients can be of any age or gender, and the popularity of the treatment is increasing every year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Where can I find a BOTOX® Injections Doctor?</h2>
                <p>BOTOX® is a prescription-only medicine and as such can only be prescribed by a Doctor after face-to-face consultation with the patient. We always do a prior consultation with patients for BOTOX® injections. All BOTOX® injections are carried out by our qualified and experienced Aesthetic Dermatologist Dr. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is BOTOX® safe?</h4>
                <p>Yes. BOTOX® has been used cosmetically for over fifteen years now, with no unexpected negative effects. It is a very popular treatment, as our many satisfied clients will attest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Will the injection hurt?</h4>
                <p>As with any needle, you might feel a pinch when the BOTOX® is injected. However, we use a very fine needle to minimize discomfort. Treatments are made as comfortable as possible according to the treatment and the individual's personal requirements. We use topical anaesthetic cream to minimize discomfort.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Are there any negative side-effects?</h4>
                <p>The most common side-effects of BOTOX® are mild pain and tenderness around the point of injection as well as very mild swelling, which should subside within 48 hours. Very occasionally, the treatment may cause other muscle groups to relax, which can give the appearance of drooping eyebrows or eyelids. This is rare, and should subside within a few weeks</p>

                <h2>Meso Botox</h2>
                <p>"Meso Botox" refers to a particularly delicate approach in administering BOTOX® injections for a particularly natural and subtle result.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, is well-known for practicing Botox. He has many loyal clients who appreciate the natural-looking results with the popular anti-ageing injections.</p>
                
                <p>Meso Botox is a term which was first coined in the USA. After movie director Martin Scorsese complained that too many of his actresses were "frozen" and unable to use normal facial expression, actresses started seeking botox treatments which while they still work, are more natural and wear off more quickly in time for their next part on the big screen.</p>
                
                <p>For further information, a confidential, no-obligation consultation with Dr Matiur R Chowdhury is the ideal opportunity to discuss the right BOTOX® approach for you.</p>

                <h3>Who is Meso Botox suitable for?</h3>
                <p>BOTOX® is a popular choice with men and women who wish to reduce the appearance of winkles and frown lines, typically around the face and neck. While this is the most common application of BOTOX®, it can also be used to treat severe brow furrow, uncontrolled blinking and lazy eyes. BOTOX® patients can be of any age or gender, and the popularity of the treatment is increasing every year.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"First timers" – those who have never had botox before and are concerned not to overdo it</li>
                    <li>Younger patients – who only need a light dose to stem the early signs of ageing</li>
                    <li>"Preventative patients" – who are using botox as a preventative measure, to suppress muscle activity so that lines and wrinkles do not develop as they tend to with non-users</li>
                    <li>Natural look seekers – patients who want an exceptionally subtle look to their results</li>
                    <li>Patients needing facial movement – e.g. actors/actresses, who want to keep their full range of facial expressions, yet have some subtle suppression of the signs of ageing so that they look good on screen or in photos</li>
