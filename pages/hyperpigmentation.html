                <h2>Understanding Hyperpigmentation</h2>
                <p>Hyperpigmentation is a skin condition which causes the skin to become darker in certain areas due to an excess production of melanin in the skin. Hyperpigmentation can be caused by sun sun exposure, pregnancy, hormonal change, hormonal oral pills etc.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How can hyperpigmentation be treated?</h2>
                <p>We offer a number of treatments for hyperpigmentation, depending on what kind of discolouration the patient is suffering from.</p>
                
                <p>Treatments include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Cosmelan Treatment Programme</li>
                    <li>Chemical Peels</li>
                    <li>Laser genesis</li>
                    <li>Carbon soft peel</li>
                    <li>Mesotherapy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>All of these are effective and straightforward. We always recommend a consultation with Dr. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury before a specific course of treatment is recommended.</p>

                <h3>Cosmelan Treatment</h3>
                <p>Cosmelan is a skin treatment regime which is specifically developed to treat hyperpigmentation.</p>
                <p>The product contains a series of active ingredients which work to prevent an essential enzyme involved in forming pigment. Cosmelan treatment improves the skin blemishes with a very high safety margin.</p>
                <p>Dr. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury is trained and experienced in this very special treatment and introduces Cosmelan in Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>It is a depigmentation agent which is applied in clinic as a mask and can be used on a number of different types of hyperpigmentation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Melasma</li>
                    <li>Brown Spots</li>

                <h2>Bright and Baby Face Technology</h2>
                <p>Skin tanning, uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation these are always an issue in the women's beauty care dictionary.</p>
                
                <p>Baby Face is a technology that can help you whiten and brighten. This technology is the result of a 10-year study by Korean Cosmetic Surgeon, a new treatment for Melasma, uneven skin tone and skin pigmentation.</p>
                
                <p>So apart from the treatment of skin pigmentation, Baby Face has overcome the disadvantage of other conventional whitening technologies: toxic, abrasive skin, peeling, causing the skin to become weak, sensitive.</p>
                
                <p>This Highly Advanced Technology helps to bring Baby Face effect into the skin, with whitening ingredients composed of natural extracts. The anti-aging nutrients, moisturizing after the penetration will stimulate the growth of stem cells, promoting self-regeneration and collagen growth to help skin firm and better elasticity.</p>
                
                <p>This technology not only helps to brighten skin color and tone, but also improves problems such as large pores, oily skin, blemishes.</p>

                <h2>Who is hyperpigmentation treatment for?</h2>
                <p>Anyone who is unhappy with the discoloration of their skin may benefit from hyperpigmentation treatment.</p>
                
                <p>Anybody can suffer from hyperpigmentation; in some cases the condition can be subtle, whereas with some people it is more pronounced. Most of our patients believe that their hyperpigmentation is too visible, and that it is causing them to feel insecure and less confident.</p>
                
                <p>We tend to see a lot of older patients opting for these treatments, because as we age, the body is less capable of producing melanin consistently and has also had more exposure to the sun's harmful rays.</p>

                <h4>How will I know which treatment is for me?</h4>
                <p>We always recommend a private consultation with Dr. Matiur Rahman Chowdhury in order to identify the most effective course of treatment. During consultation, we assess your skin type, the type and severity of hyperpigmentation, and your medical history to recommend the best treatment plan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How can I stop my hyperpigmentation from returning after treatment?</h4>
                <p>You can try to reduce any subsequent hyperpigmentation by reducing your exposure to the sun and using sunscreen regularly. We also recommend a maintenance skincare routine and periodic follow-up treatments as needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Will it take long to recover?</h4>
                <p>Your recovery time will depend on the treatment you elect for, but will vary from a few hours to a few weeks. We will provide complete information about your chosen procedure prior to commencing treatment.</p>

                <h4>Cosmelan Treatment FAQ</h4>
                <p><strong>What other results can I expect from Cosmelan?</strong><br>
                As well as improving hyperpigmentation, many clients may see improvement in other areas too, such as: reduced pore size, improvement to greasy skin, improved sun damage, nicer skin texture.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How does the treatment feel?</strong><br>
                The application of the Mask is completely painless. However when the skin starts to peel, it's normal to feel a mild burning sensation with some itching and sensitivity.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Are there any Downtime?</strong><br>
                The peel has a high safety margin and can be safely used on dark skin types. Adverse Reactions to the Peels are rare but can include peeling, redness, scabbing. You will need to leave the Mask on for up to 12 hours on the skin. Ideally, it is better to take a week off work. Your skin will peel a lot in the first week – you can peel after the first week but it will not be as noticeable. You will have dryness, tightness, soreness and itching for up to 4 weeks after the treatment.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Is there any Aftercare/ Homecare?</strong><br>
                It is essential to follow a homecare routine. You will need to ensure that you use the maintenance cream every day according to the instructions. You will need to ensure that you keep your skin well moisturized with moisturizer cream and most importantly that you apply SPF 50 Sun Protection cream every day.</p>
