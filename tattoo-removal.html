                <h2>Professional Tattoo Removal</h2>
                <p>Tattoos have become increasingly popular among people of all ages around the world and thus a growing need for tattoo modification and removal has arisen.</p>
                <p>It's no surprise that one in six people hate their tattoos and want them removed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Consider Tattoo Removal?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tattoos that may once have represented a special relationship or a different stage in life have now become a source of regret.</li>
                    <li>You had the tattoo done on the whim and did not put much thought into it, and now you no longer want it.</li>
                    <li>You got the tattoo inked in a location you are now embarrassed to show.</li>
                    <li>Now that you're older and the skin texture has changed, you no longer like the way the tattoo looks.</li>
                    <li>Your tattoo is in a visible place which holds you back in your career.</li>
                    <li>You are not happy with the way the tattoo was inked or the design or it has started to fade.</li>
                    <li>You need to have the tattoo faded to have another cover up tattoo over it.</li>
                    <li>Whatever your reason for wanting the tattoo removed, we can help get rid of the ink.</li>
                    <li>Our Advanced Laser technology is the best method for the safe removal of both amateur and professional tattoos.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How our treatment works?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We use a high a powered beam of laser light in an extremely short pulse.</li>
                    <li>The short pulse of this laser is absorbed by the tattoo ink particles, this shatters the tattoo breaking it down into smaller pieces, enabling your natural immune defences to absorb the ink and easily eliminate it from the body.</li>
                    <li>You have to be patient to see results as this elimination process can take a couple of months.</li>
                    <li>A gradual fading of the tattoo occurs over a series of treatments.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Results from Tattoo Removal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Results are not immediately visible, however over the following months after the treatment, the body's white blood cells will clear away the ink particles and the tattoo will fade.</li>
                    <li>Has a positive impact on your life getting rid of a tattoo that you hate.</li>

                <h3>Factors influencing Tattoo Removal</h3>
                <p>Successful removal depends on a number of factors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is that Tattoo new or old? A very new tattoo is more difficult to remove because of the density of colours used.</li>
                    <li>Professional Tattoo or Amateur. Professional Tattoos are more difficult to remove because the ink is deeper in the dermis.</li>
                    <li>Colour of Tattoos: Single colour Tattoos are a lot easier to remove than Multi coloured Tattoos.</li>
                    <li>Colour of Skin: The darker the skin the more difficult it is to remove a Tattoo because high energies cannot be used due to a risk of hyper or hypopigmentation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Tattoo Removal FAQ</h2>
                <div class="title-divider"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How long does the treatment take?</h4>
                <p>Treatment time varies depending upon the size of the tattoo but generally, is between 10-30 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How does the treatment feel?</h4>
                <p>Most patients describe the sensation as similar to a hot pin pick or the flick of an elastic band. Whilst uncomfortable most people tolerate the treatment well. Our ice cooler is used before, during and after the treatment. You have the option of using a local anaesthetic cream before the treatments to make the treatment pain free.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>How many treatments are required?</h4>
                <p>Efficacy of treatment is dependent upon the specific tattoo ink present and it is difficult to determine exactly what inks and colouring compounds have been used. Two similar colours may be composed of very different materials.</p>
                <p>Generally, professional tattoos are harder to remove as they are usually deeper in the dermis, are denser and may consist of multiple colouring agents.</p>
                <p>Amateur tattoos can be quick to remove, taking 1-6 treatments, whereas professional tattoos vary considerably and some can take up to 15 treatments.</p>
                <p>Efficacy also depends on the age of the tattoo.</p>
                <p>Sessions are spaced 6 to 10 weeks apart.</p>
                <p>At your consultation, the therapist will be able to give you a better indication of the number of treatments required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Are there any possible side effects/Downtime?</h4>
                <p>Short term side effects include excessive swelling, pinpoint bleeding, crusting and blistering.</p>
                <p>An initial whitening of the treated area is the first sign of a positive reaction.</p>
                <p>This blanched area will fade after approximately five to ten minutes, leaving the surrounding area red, raised and inflamed.</p>
                <p>Very rarely the skin may become lighter or darker, or a small blister may form. In most cases, this will resolve within a period of time.</p>
                <p>On very dark skin there is more likelihood of complications such as hyper or hypo pigmentation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is there any Aftercare/Homecare?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any blistering should be left to heal naturally (red tattoos tend to show more blistering).</li>
                    <li>Client should use sun protection cream and avoid sun exposure on the treated area.</li>
                    <li>Do not use bleaching creams or perfumed products on the area for 1 week after the treatment.</li>
                    <li>If blistering or crusting occurs do not pick or scratch the treated area as this could result in scar tissue formation.</li>
                    <li>Avoid very hot baths, showers, steam rooms, saunas for 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>Keep the area clean and dry.</li>
                    <li>If the area feels hot or swollen, the use of ice packs or aloe vera gel etc can improve client comfort and reduce erythema and swelling.</li>
                    <li>If pin-point bleeding has occurred, the area can be covered with a paraffin gauze dressing to avoid contact with clothing. Crusting may develop after a few days and this should be left to heal naturally.</li>
                </ul>
